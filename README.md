1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaskPulse.git
   cd TaskPulse
2. **Backend Setup**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder.
   - Add the following variables to the `.env` file:
     ```env
     PORT=8080
     MONGODB_URL=<Your MongoDB Connection URL>
     ENCRYPTION_REF=<Your Encryption Reference>
     ```
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Run the backend server with the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   Ensure that you have a MongoDB instance running and replace `<Your MongoDB Connection URL>` with the appropriate connection URL. The `ENCRYPTION_REF` is a reference used for encryption; replace it with a secret key for your application.
3. **Frontend Setup**:

   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the frontend development server with the following command:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   The frontend development server will start, and you can access the application at `localhost server` by default. Make sure to complete the backend setup (as mentioned in step 2) before running the frontend to ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend.
4. **Pushing Changes to GitHub**:

   Once you have made your changes and finalized your code in the local files, follow these steps to push the changes to GitHub:

   - Create a new branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git branch <your_branch_name>
     ```

   - Switch to the new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout <your_branch_name>
     ```

   - Add all changes to the staging area:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

   - Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your commit message here"
     ```

   - Push the changes to the remote repository (GitHub):
     ```bash
     git push origin <your_branch_name>
     ```

   After pushing the changes, you can create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch or any desired target branch.

   Note: Make sure you replace `<your_branch_name>` with the actual name you chose for your new branch.
